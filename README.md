大家好，我叫宋鑫，家乡湖北武汉，12年毕业于长江大学，计算机专业，  
目前深圳定居，前不久刚离职，主要是做Java后端开发这块的。  
有近10多年的编程经验和5年的架构经验，还有近10年的业余股票投机经验。  
**我的兴趣爱好目前保留的有：**  
读书，写作（博客和日记），思考，音乐（古典，摇滚，新世纪），独自旅行，  
**我之前的兴趣爱好有**：  
打游戏，WOW骨灰级玩家，Dota天梯大神，  
德州扑克：二年业余线上PokerStars玩家，嗯，输了几千美金。  

我目前的主要方向是：思考技术如何变现，以及深入理解商业和产品，思考各种赚钱的可能性。  
同时也寻求缺乏技术的优秀创业团队。  
目前的规划是：花3年时间，复用编程技能，转到黑客安全方向。  
毕竟互联网企业想爬上去得会搞人际关系，同时必须得有亿亿级高并发的项目经验，最基本的你得有一个亮瞎面试官氪金狗眼的履历。

Hello everyone,My name is Songxin,My hometown is Wuhan City HuBei Province,  
Graduate from University of Yangtze, CS Major，  
I am now Live in Shen Zhen city,quitted not long agon,worked as a Java backend Developer.  
I have more than 10 years Programming experience,nearly 10 years Stock Speculation experience. 

**My hobbies are**  
Reading, writing (blogging and diaries), thinking, music (classical, rock, new century), traveling alone,  
**My previous hobbies are**   
Playing games, wow ashes player, dota ladder God,  
Texas Poker: two years of amateur online poker stars players, well, lost thousands of dollars.  


My current main direction is to think about how to realize technology, deeply understand business and products,   
and think about all kinds of possibilities to make money.  
At the same time, I also seek excellent entrepreneurial teams lacking developer parters.  
The current plan is to spend three years reusing programming skills and turning to hacker security.  
After all, if Internet companies want to climb up, they must be able to engage in interpersonal relationships. 
At the same time, they must have billion level high concurrent project experience. 
The most basic requirement is that you must have a resume that highlights the blind interviewer's krypton golden dog eye.
